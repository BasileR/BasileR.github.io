I am a PhD student in computer science and remote sensing for demography since November 2021, under the supervision of [Sylvain Lobry, LIPADE](https://www.sylvainlobry.com/), [Géraldine Duthé, Ined](https://www.ined.fr/en/research/researchers/Duth%C3%A9+G%C3%A9raldine), [Valérie Golaz,Ined](https://www.ined.fr/en/research/researchers/Golaz+Val%C3%A9rie),[LPED](https://www.lped.fr/) and [Laurent Wendling,LIPADE](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Bsl0MtgAAAAJ&hl=fr).

<p style="text-align: justify"> 
I am working on the use of remote sensing images for demography analysis in Sub-Saharan countries. In a globalized context increasingly impacted by climate change, demographic studies would gain from taking environmental data into account. However, it is not always possible in Sub-Saharan Africa, as matching harmonized demographic and envrionemental data are seldom available. The goal of this PhD is to take advantage of the large amount of data producted by Earth imagery, as Sentinel from ESA, to develop robust environmental indicators that can increase our understanding of demographic studies.
